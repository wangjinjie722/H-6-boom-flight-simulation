# OpenGL-flight-simulation
### This is the project of my naive undergraduate thesis. Honestly, it's ungly, rough and simple. But this is the start of my coding career

In this project, I used **OpenGL, C++ and 3DSmax** to simulate the flight process of airplane. I hope this can help the people whos in the same dilemma as me one year ago.

OpenGL may not be a popular frame for simulation, there's still another excellent frames, like WebGL which has more extensions and better community. The airplane model I used in the demo is not supposed to be used to make profits, so I removed it with the Matlab connection part. 

If u still need it, please feel free to email me but I may not give it to u lol.

- TODO list:
  - Change the terrian(use WebGL please).
  - Add more shadows.
  - Seperate the components of the plane.
